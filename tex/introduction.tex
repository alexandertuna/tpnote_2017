\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

We investigate the performance of the Micromegas Address in Real Time (ART) and trigger processor. This is one of the two trigger technologies introduced for the New Small Wheel (NSW) upgrade of the ATLAS muon spectrometer, which is intended to be built and installed in the coming years. 

The performance is measured with hundreds of thousands of cosmic muons recorded at the Harvard cosmic ray test stand, which employs a full trigger electronics path with prototype hardware: MMFE8s equipped with VMM2, the FPGA-based ADDC V1, and a Micromegas trigger processor (MMTP) implemented on a VC707 FPGA evaluation board.

This note presents the performance of the trigger data path; the full readout data path is described in previous notes~\cite{noisy,noiseless} using the same detectors and similar electronics. The reader is encouraged to read these notes for complementary measurements and a better understanding of the performance of the Micromegas detectors and electronics in a broader context.
