\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

We have implemented and debugged the firmware of the Micromegas trigger processor (MMTP) hosted momentarily
in a VC707 FPGA evaluation board.
The MMTP is one of many modules contributing to the formation of the Level-1 muon end-cap
 trigger for the New Small Wheel (NSW) upgrade of the ATLAS muon spectrometer~\cite{nswtdr}.
 The MMTP  uses  the  Address in Real Time (ART) signals issued by each VMM in the MMFE8 front-end boards
 and formatted by an intermediate board called the Art Data Driver Card (ADDC). 



The MMTP performance is measured using our Micromegas octuplet equipped with MMFE8 front-end boards which use the 
VMM2 ASIC~\cite{noisy,noiseless}. Following the  NSW TDR design, the ART signals are sent to the trigger processor via optical links
 in two steps. First, the ART signals of each board are deserialized and reformatted with 2 FPGA-based ADDC V1 cards.  

 In these conditions,  several millions of cosmic muons have been collected with the Harvard cosmic ray telescope and are used 
to evaluate the performance of the Micromegas trigger system reported in this note.
